# TipCalculator
This calculator is used to eaqually split up tips based on the numbers of hours worked by each employee. 
The app uses python and flask as a backend to read a payroll report and generate a list of employees and the tips they should receive. 
It's then compiled into an exe using pyinstaller so it can be run on computers that don't have python available.
The front end uses VUE.js to display the information and axios to talk with the backend.

Use /src/scripts/build_app.bat to compile the program into "Tip Calculator.exe" and run it.

*Note: The reports are specific to who the app was created for and cannot be added to the repository for obvious reasons.
